## Warehouse Management System

### Description

This application will help a big corps to **manage** a warehouse
by *adding stock* and changing **and** exporting at will.
This is an interesting topic as there are a lot of good aspects 
and problems that I would like to try.


## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to create and add new stock(item) to the warehouse.
- As a user, I want to be able to display all items.
- As a user, I want to be able to remove items.
- As a user, I want to be able to change status of the warehouse(full or not)
- As a user, I want to save a database
- As a user, I want to load the database

## Instructions for Grader
1. input Name and Quantity then hit Add Item
2. All the items can be displayed by using Display all button
3. The other required events are Display all(displays all the items), Remove Item(removes the selected item from the list), Change Status(changes the warehouse full status)
4. The visual component can be found by clicking Calm me pls button
5. The data is saved by pressing Save DB button
6. The data is loaded by pressing Load DB button

## Phase 4: Task 3

The Refactoring I would do if I had more time is on increasing cohesion in my WarehouseUI class, I believe I can separate some tasks into other classes specifically setting functionality of the components. 
Moreover, I can reduce coupling in the JList Panel and also in the dialog boxes. 
There is not much work to do in terms of refactoring since I took a lot of time designing this project structure before hand.
